/**
 * A named function intermediate representation.
 *
 * A named function is one of the major entity in PHP. It has zero or many
 * inputs, and zero or one output. Each input is represented by a
 * `Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Parameter` instance, while the
 * output is represented by a `Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Type`
 * instance.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * In this example, a new function `f` is created with 1 input: `int $x`, and 1 output: `int`.
 *
 * ```php
 * $typeInt = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Type();
 * $typeInt-&gt;name = 'int';
 *
 * $input1 = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Parameter('x');
 * $input1-&gt;type = $typeInt;
 *
 * $output = $typeInt;
 *
 * $function = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Function_('f');
 * $function-&gt;inputs[] = $input1;
 * $function-&gt;output   = $output;
 * ```
