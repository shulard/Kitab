/**
 * A method intermediate representation.
 *
 * A method is a function inside a class. Contrary to a function, it receives
 * an implicit `$this` argument representing the object (class instance),
 * except for static method. Just like a function, it has zero or many inputs,
 * and zero or one output. Each input is represented by a
 * `Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Parameter` instance, while the
 * output is represented by a `Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Type`
 * instance. A method also has a visiblity, can be abstract (if the class is
 * abstract), and can be final (cannot be overriden by a child class).
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * In this example, a new method `f` is created with 1 input: `int $x`, and
 * 1 output: `int`.
 *
 * ```php
 * $typeInt = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Type();
 * $typeInt-&gt;name = 'int';
 *
 * $input1 = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Parameter('x');
 * $input1-&gt;type = $typeInt;
 *
 * $output = $typeInt;
 *
 * $method = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Method('f');
 * $method-&gt;inputs[] = $input1;
 * $method-&gt;output   = $output;
 * ```
