/**
 * A type intermediate representation.
 *
 * A type has a name. It can represent a value passed by copy or by
 * reference. It can be nullable, i.e. null value can be considered as valid.
 *
 * Because values in PHP are represented by union types (many types), the type
 * of a value can be undeclared (and decided at runtime). Thus, a type can
 * have no name in this intermediate representation.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * The following example builds a nullable reference type `T`.
 *
 * ```php
 * $type = new Kitab\Compiler\IntermediateRepresentation\Type();
 * $type-&gt;name      = 'T';
 * $type-&gt;reference = true;
 * $type-&gt;nullable  = true;
 *
 * assert('?T &amp;' === (string) $type);
 * ```
